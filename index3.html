	<h1>And if you threw a party - invited everyone you knew</h1>
	<p>Busey ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. When you get lost in your imaginatory vagueness, your foresight will become a nimble vagrant. I wrestled a bear once. A 750lbs black bear. You dip it in the horse radish, let it pee it off, dip it in the salsa sauce, one drip and thats it.</p>		

	<h2>They'll have to make the best of things its an uphill climb.</h2>
	<p>Go with the feeling of the nature. Take it easy. Know why you're here. And remeber to balance your internal energy with the environment. <span class= "highlight">You gotta go through it to see there ain't nothing to it.</span> You suck the oysters up and you always keep some on your face to let the oysters know that you're proud of em.</p>		

	<h2>Friendly neighbors there that's where we meet. </h2>
	<p>It's OK to get Rib-grease on your face, because you're allowing people to see that you're proud of these ribs. I would like to give you a backstage pass to my imagination. It's OK to get Rib-grease on your face, because you're allowing people to see that you're proud of these ribs.</p>		

	<h2>You wanna be where you can see our troubles are all the same.</h2>
	<p>It's good for everyone to understand that they are to love their enemies, simply because your enemies show you things about yourself you need to change. So in actuality enemies are friends in reverse. This is just common superficiality. Is thats whats so special about a woman? Superficiality with their face colours?</p>

	<h2>And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder flying there-under under the sea.</h2>
	<p>I've accepted the fact that what I want to do to find whats special about a woman is to be with women. And dress like them. And let them tell me what they feel like when they're dressed like that, because I can't do that if I go in there dressed like a man. </p>		

	<h1>Said Californ'y is the place you ought to be</h1>
	<p>Go with the feeling of the nature. Take it easy. Know why you're here. And remeber to balance your internal energy with the environment. Sometimes horses cough and fart at the same time, so stay out of the range of its butt muscle because a horses butt muscle is thick.</p>
